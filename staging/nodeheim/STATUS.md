# Project Status

## Status Update - [2024-12-04]

### Current Status
- Created clean Nodeheim app structure (removed -splunk suffix)
- Implemented comprehensive network analyzer dashboard
- Added network discovery functionality using nmap
- Installed required Python dependencies in Splunk container

### Recent Progress
- ✅ Created dark-themed network analysis dashboard
- ✅ Implemented network scanner with nmap integration
- ✅ Added security metrics and vulnerability assessment
- ✅ Set up proper app directory structure
- ✅ Updated app configurations for clean naming

### Current Issues
1. Version Management
   - Multiple 1.0.0 files in directory
   - Need versioning strategy for updates
   - Should clean up old package files

2. Testing Requirements
   - Need to verify network scanner functionality
   - Dashboard needs real data testing
   - Security metrics validation needed

3. Dashboard Interface
   - Network Analysis page lacks network selection interface
   - No way to input subnet for scanning
   - Missing scan type selection (basic/full)
   - Need to add form inputs for network discovery

### Next Steps
1. Version Management:
   ```
   Current: 1.0.0 (Base functionality)
   Next: 1.0.1 (Dashboard Interface Update)
   Future: 1.1.0 (Network Discovery Enhancement)
   ```

2. Clean-up Tasks:
   - Remove old .spl and .tar.gz files after 1.0.1 update
   - Archive or delete old nodeheim-splunk directory
   - Implement version tracking in package script

3. Dashboard Enhancement (1.0.1):
   - Add subnet input field
   - Add scan type selector (basic/full)
   - Add scan trigger button
   - Add scan progress indicator
   - Add error handling display

4. Testing Plan:
   - Test network scanner on local subnet
   - Verify dashboard data population
   - Validate security metrics accuracy

### Previous Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed app folder naming convention
- ✅ Implemented proper Python path handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive error logging
- ✅ Created responsive dashboard design
- ✅ Added proper app configuration files

### Notes
- Remember to use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features, backward compatible
- Patch: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Required Testing
1. Network Scanner:
   ```splunk
   | nodeheim_scan subnet="192.168.1.0/24"
   ```

2. Dashboard Verification:
   - Check all panels populate
   - Verify metric calculations
   - Test responsive design
   - Verify network selection interface (after 1.0.1)

3. Security Checks:
   - Validate port scanning
   - Test service detection
   - Verify vulnerability assessment

### Next Release (1.0.1) Priority Tasks
1. Add Network Selection Interface:
   - Subnet input field with validation
   - Scan type dropdown (basic/full)
   - Start scan button
   - Progress indicator
   - Error message display

2. Update Dashboard Layout:
   - Add input panel at top
   - Reorganize metrics display
   - Add scan history section
   - Improve error visibility
