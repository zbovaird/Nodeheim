# Project Status

## Status Update - [Current Date]

### Current Status
- Splunk container needs restart after configuration changes
- Fixed command names to use underscores (nodeheim_scan) instead of hyphens
- Updated local/commands.conf with proper paths
- Added searchbnf.conf for command suggestions

### Recent Progress
- ✅ Fixed command name consistency (using underscores)
- ✅ Added local/commands.conf with proper paths
- ✅ Added searchbnf.conf for command definitions
- ✅ Updated app permissions in container

### Current Issues
1. Splunk Restart Required
   - Container needs restart after configuration changes
   - Web interface may need time to become available

2. Command Registration
   - Commands need verification after restart
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use underscore not hyphen when testing commands
     - Correct: `| nodeheim_scan`
     - Incorrect: `| nodeheim-scan`

### Next Steps
1. After system restart:
   ```powershell
   # Start Splunk container
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 8089:8089 -p 9997:9997 --name splunk -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=Password123" splunk/splunk:latest
   
   # Copy app to container
   docker cp nodeheim-splunk splunk:/opt/splunk/etc/apps/
   
   # Set permissions
   docker exec -u root -it splunk chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk/etc/apps/nodeheim-splunk
   docker exec -u root -it splunk chmod -R 755 /opt/splunk/etc/apps/nodeheim-splunk/bin
   
   # Create log directory
   docker exec -u root -it splunk mkdir -p /opt/splunk/etc/apps/nodeheim-splunk/var/log
   docker exec -u root -it splunk chown splunk:splunk /opt/splunk/etc/apps/nodeheim-splunk/var/log
   ```

2. Verify functionality:
   - Access Splunk at http://localhost:8000
   - Login with admin/Password123
   - Navigate to search
   - Type `|` then start typing `nodeheim_` (with underscore)
   - Command should appear in suggestions

### Previous Issues Resolved
- ✅ Updated app.conf with better configuration
- ✅ Implemented pure Python network scanning
- ✅ Fixed command name consistency (underscore vs hyphen)
- ✅ Added proper logging to scanner code
- ✅ Added searchbnf.conf for command definitions

### Notes
- Remember to use underscore (_) not hyphen (-) in commands:
  - `| nodeheim_scan` ✅
  - `| nodeheim-scan` ❌
